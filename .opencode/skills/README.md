# Skills Pack

This repository publishes a single integrated memory skill:

- `diasync-memory`

Install path for OpenCode:

- `.opencode/skills/diasync-memory/SKILL.md`

Why single skill:

- unified install and upgrade
- single operational contract
- coherent lifecycle management for `.memory`

`diasync-memory` still uses progressive disclosure by loading reference docs only when needed.

See `PUBLISHING.md` for release steps.
